## Vector Layer

Vector 레이어를 생성하기 위해서는 우선 내가 생성하고자 하는 레이어의 데이터가 필요합니다.
택지정보시스템에서 제공하는 지구정보데이터 중 하나의 데이터를 커스터마이징하여 사용하였습니다.
먼저 Vector Layer 를 생성하기 위해 배경지도 맵을 생성합니다.

```jsx
// 배경지도 레이어
let layers = [
  new ol.layer.Tile({
    source: new ol.source.OSM(),
  }),
];
// 배경지도의 해상도, 위치, 레벨 설정
let view = new ol.View({
  center: [127.10369206558485, 37.462755923721225],
  projection: "EPSG:4326",
  zoom: 15,
});
// WFS Layer(Vector) 가 있는 Map
const map = new ol.Map({
  layers: layers,
  id: "map",
  target: "map",
  view: view,
});
```

위와 같이 각각의 객체를 나누어 사용하여도 되고,

```jsx
const map = new ol.Map({
  layers: [
    new ol.layer.Tile({
      source: new ol.source.OSM(),
    }),
  ],
  id: "map",
  target: "map",
  view: new ol.View({
    center: [127.10369206558485, 37.462755923721225],
    projection: "EPSG:4326",
    zoom: 15,
  }),
});
```

한번에 선언하여 맵을 사용할 수 있습니다.

이렇게 배경지도를 생성하고 난 뒤 Vector Layer를 생성할 차레입니다.
Vector Layer는 Openlayers에서 제공하는 포맷 중 하나인 GeoJSON 형식으로 가지고 왔습니다.

```

이 데이터를 이제 Vector Layer로 생성하는데, 이때 Openlayers의 ol.format.GeoJSON() 을 사용합니다.

```jsx
// geojson이 담길 vector layer의 feature(단위 집합들)
let features = new ol.format.GeoJSON().readFeatures(geoJson);
// feature 들을 담을 vector source
let vectorSource = new ol.source.Vector({
  features: features,
});
```

이렇게 feature를 source에 담아 생성한 뒤 레이어를 생성하면 Vector Layer가 생성되고 이를 map 객체에 addLayer 함수를 이용해 추가해주면 지도화면에 데이터가 지도로 표출됩니다.

```jsx
// vector layer
let vectorLayer = new ol.layer.Vector({
  source: vectorSource,
});

map.addLayer(vectorLayer); // vector layer를 Map에 추가
```

![](../img/vector.png)

위와 같은 화면이 나타나면 정상적으로 Vector Layer를 생성한 것입니다.
Openlayers 에서 Vector Layer의 Default 색상을 저렇게 표현합니다.

![](../img/vector1.png)

Vector Layer에 스타일을 적용하게 되면 이렇게 눈에 확 띄는 색상이라던지 내가 원하는 다양한 색을 입혀볼 수 있습니다.
스타일을 적용하기 위해서는 Style 객체를 사용해야 하는데요.

```jsx
// 벡터 레이어의 스타일 색
let style = new ol.style.Style({
  fill: new ol.style.Fill({ color: "rgba(215, 35, 77, 1)" }), // rgb 코드 사용 가능
  // fill : new ol.style.Fill({color : '#d7234d'}), // HEX 코드 사용 가능
  stroke: new ol.style.Stroke({ color: "rgba(34, 160, 235, 1)" }),
});
```

이렇게 스타일 객체를 생성할 수 있습니다.

내가 원하는 색을 넣은 스타일 객체를 이제 Vector Layer 에 적용해주면 되는데, 위에서 언급했듯이 Vector Layer 는 Vector Source 를 가지고 있고 그 안에 Feature 들이 집합으로 있기 때문에 Feature 에다가 스타일을 적용해야 합니다.

```jsx
// feature에 스타일 적용(feature는 배열 구조로 수많은 feature가 있을 수 있다)
for (var i in features) features[i].setStyle(style);
```

이렇게 해주면 내가 원하는 색상도 스타일 객체를 통해 Vector Layer에 담게 되었습니다.

생성한 Vector Layer를 클릭하여 원하는 정보를 볼 수 있습니다.
위에 선언한 geoJson에는 여러 데이터가 존재하는데, 그 중에서 key가 "zoneName"인 데이터를 화면에 나타내보도록 하겠습니다.

```jsx
// feature를 클릭할 수 있는 select
let selectSingleClick = new ol.interaction.Select({
  condition: ol.events.condition.click, // click 하는 이벤트 (pointMove, singleclick, altClick 등)
  style: new ol.style.Style({
    stroke: new ol.style.Stroke({
      color: "white",
      width: 2,
    }),
    fill: new ol.style.Fill({
      color: "rgba(0,0,255,0.6)",
    }),
  }),
});
```

Vector Layer의 feature를 클릭하여 선택하는 Select객체를 생성합니다.

- condition : Select 객체 사용시 click, move 등의 이벤트를 설정

- style : Select 객체 사용시 색상 변경

```jsx
// map 객체에 add
map.addInteraction(selectSingleClick);
```

Map객체에 Select객체를 추가해줍니다.

그리고나서 마지막으로 생성한 Vector Layer의 feature를 클릭할 경우의 이벤트 함수를 작성해줍니다.

```jsx
// 기존 색상을 담는 객체
let \_style = null;
// feature 를 선택할 때 이벤트
selectSingleClick.on('select', function(e) {
if(e.target.getFeatures().a[0] != undefined){
\_style = e.target.getFeatures().a[0]; // 기존 색상 담기
e.target.getFeatures().a[0].setStyle(null); // 기존 색상 제거
}
if(e.target.getFeatures().a.length > 0){
document.getElementById('info').innerHTML = e.target.getFeatures().a[0].N.zoneName;
}else{
\_style.setStyle(style); // 기존 색상 추가
document.getElementById('info').innerHTML = "";
}
});
```

### Vector Layer feature 클릭 이벤트 화면

이렇게 색상을 변경함으로써 어떤 feature 를 선택했는지와 선택한 feature 의 data도 불러온 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.
